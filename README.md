## How it Works


The Basics of C.R.U.D routes

* Signup to the website using email/ or login if you have already signed up
* After authorization you will be linked to a search page
  * Here you have the option to search all current and former NBA players
  * A list shall then genrate with the name or names of the players
  you searched
* You will then have the option to click a button to learn more about the player where a detail page will pull up displaying stats and other information
* Then you will have the option to add that player to a favorites list.
  * After that you will have the option of deleting the player from your list if you choose to.
  * Finally you will have the option to edit your username.

#### Day 1

On day one I wanted to get my API. So i started searching for great API's for all sports. But because a lot of sports API's are paid it was very tough. Thankfully I Found a simple Api but because it is not paid the stats were very old so I had to try and work around it.

#### Day 2

After pulling the data i wanted from the API. I know was focused on how I was going to relate that data to my models. So I subscribed to LucidCharts.com in order to create my models. 

#### Day 3-4
I had to incorporate the authorization page and link that to the routes that i created. I hit a bit of a snag here because the routes werent connecting. Ultimately I figured it out and was able to take the users authorization information and link it to my routes and save all that info into a database to then access it at a later time.

#### Day 5-6
I had to finish my delete and put routes. The delete was relatively easy but the put route gave me the most trouble because i was trying to change the information from my api instead of the info from my database. After much struggle i created a quick fix for it to be able to change the user name on the profile page.

#### All in All
Felt like i learned a lot from this project. I defintely need to come back to this App and do more styling and create a put route to edit the data for the user name as well as any other data on the page.
